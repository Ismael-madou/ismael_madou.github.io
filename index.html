  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
    Attached to team spirit, tolerance, and continuous learning, I want to grow in an environment where constructive exchanges and collaboration are at the core of projects.  
    I am convinced that the success of a team relies as much on the quality of human relationships as on technical skills.  
    This is why I am looking for a final-year internship starting on <b>February 23, 2026</b>, to put my knowledge in data at the service of a dynamic team in a fast-evolving sector such as <b>Transport</b>.  
    My objective is to contribute to collective success while enriching my skills.

  <h2 style="color: white; margin-bottom: 1rem;">My Story</h2>
  <p>
    I was born in 2003 in Niamey, Niger, into a Kanouri family from Zinder and Diffa, regions in the southeastern part of the country. 
    Although I grew up in the capital, I was deeply marked by the rural origins of my parents. 
    Their stories of perseverance, solidarity, and community spirit shaped my vision of life from an early age.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, I realized that many people living in these villages had not chosen the circumstances they were born into. 
    They simply inherited them. Yet, despite the lack of resources, their resilience and ability to find happiness in small things impressed me deeply. 
    This reality sparked in me the desire to pursue studies that could one day help improve living conditions in Niger and Africa as a whole.
  </p>

  <p>
    During my final year of high school, I was torn between my passion for mathematics and my desire to engage in fields that could have a tangible social impact. 
    After much reflection, I chose to continue my studies in economics, which I saw as a discipline combining rigor, logic, and applicability to the real world.
  </p>

  <p>
    After two years of studying Economic Engineering, I discovered my real interest in quantitative methods, statistics, and data analysis. 
    This led me to pursue a Master‚Äôs degree in Statistics for Evaluation and Forecasting, where I now seek to bridge technical skills with issues of public policy, 
    economic development, and data-driven decision-making.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have faced many challenges and failures in my life, but I have always viewed them as learning opportunities. 
    Every obstacle has strengthened my resilience and my determination to move forward. 
    This mindset has become one of my greatest strengths, allowing me to remain focused on my goals while staying humble.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking forward, I aspire to work as a Data Engineer or Analyst in fields such as transport, finance, or development economics. 
    My ambition is to contribute to collective progress while staying true to the values instilled in me since childhood: 
    solidarity, perseverance, and the pursuit of excellence.
