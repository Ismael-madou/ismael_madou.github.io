    Attached to team spirit, tolerance, and continuous learning, I want to grow in an environment where constructive exchanges and collaboration are at the core of projects.  
    I am convinced that the success of a team relies as much on the quality of human relationships as on technical skills.  
    This is why I am looking for a final-year internship starting on <b>February 23, 2026</b>, to put my knowledge in data at the service of a dynamic team in a fast-evolving sector such as <b>Transport</b>.  
    My objective is to contribute to collective success while enriching my skills.

  <!-- History / My Story -->
<section style="background: #f39c12; color: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 15px; margin: 2rem 1rem;">
  <h2 style="color: white; margin-bottom: 1rem;">My Story</h2>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
    <!-- Ici tu mettras ton texte long racontant ton histoire depuis le plus jeune âge -->
    I was born in 2003 in Niamey, Niger, into a Kanouri family from Zinder and Diffa. From a young age, I spent almost every vacation in my family's villages, surrounded by lush nature and a vibrant community. These experiences taught me valuable lessons about life and made me deeply aware of the privilege I had growing up in a modest yet supportive family.
    <br><br>
    Over time, I realized that many people living in these villages had not chosen their circumstances, and a strong sense of purpose awakened within me. From that moment, I knew I wanted to help them in any way I could. Initially, I dreamed of becoming a doctor to heal as many people as possible. However, as I grew older, I understood that I could have an even greater impact in the field of economics.
    <br><br>
    During my final year of high school, I was torn between my passion for mathematics, physics, and my childhood dream of becoming a pilot. I applied for scholarships in Tunisia for Economics and in Morocco for the preparatory program for aviation studies. I was accepted by both, but the Nigerien government requires a choice if multiple scholarships are awarded. Tunisia responded first, and I decided to pursue my studies there.
    <br><br>
    After two years of studying Economic Engineering, I discovered a strong interest in statistics and econometrics. This led me to apply for a Master's program in Statistics for Evaluation and Forecasting in France under the Eiffel Scholarship. Although I was selected by the program coordinator and the university, I was not chosen by the Eiffel jury. This was a difficult moment, but I refused to give up, convinced that hard work would eventually pay off.
    <br><br>
    I have faced many challenges and failures in my life, but each time I rose stronger, driven by determination and the desire to succeed. As Winston Churchill once said, "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts." Today, I am proud of my journey and my achievements, but I know there is still much to do, as millions of Nigeriens need support.
    <br><br>
    Looking forward, I aspire to work as a Data Engineer or data scientist in a company to gain experience, then return to Niger to develop the data ecosystem and help digitalize the country. I may also consider pursuing a PhD in Development Economics to further contribute to progress in my homeland. Many paths are possible, but as the saying goes, "We propose, God disposes." I let the future guide me. Thank you, and I look forward to the journey ahead.
